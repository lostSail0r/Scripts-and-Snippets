May have to run setup from speedtest-cli folder (setup.py) and/or add the path as env variable otherwise it can only be ran via cmd from that directory with the .bat and .py

Fun fact: Create a shortcut of internetSpeed.bat and place on desktop - Right-click->properties>shortcut section and make keyboard shortcut (eg I press CTRl+ALT+DownArrow and it launches a lightweight cmd-driven down/up speed test
Pretty nifty but I found the .py somewhere so I can only take credit for making it more convenient to launch - No point in re-inventing the wheel (writing custom python speed test script) for a feature available free on a million websites lol
